# 🧭 Problem Reporting and Self-Diagnosis Guide

Before submitting a report, please **pause and think** through the following checklist.  
Doing so helps ensure that your issue is reproducible, clear, and easy for others to assist with.

---

## 💡 Before You Report

1. **Has this issue occurred before?**  
   Try solving it yourself first — search on **Baidu** or refer to the **curriculum / documentation**.

   > If it still cannot be solved, proceed to report.

2. **Does the problem occur every time you run the program?**  
   Consistency helps identify whether it’s an environment issue or a random glitch.

3. **Can you provide enough information for others to reproduce the issue?**  
   Include logs, screenshots, and any relevant settings.

4. **Make your report readable and attractive.**  
   Well-formatted colour-coded logs or screenshots (for example, posted in the QQ group) encourage others to help.

## 🎨 Problem Type vs. Reporting Requirements
*(🟡 Yellow items are **required**)*

---

### 🧱 “I’m stuck on page XXX!”

🟡 **(1)** 1280×720 game resolution when stuck (e.g., *MuMu on F9*).  
(2) Provide a **BAAS log screenshot**.  
(3) Try switching between pages to confirm if the freeze happens only on one page.

---

### 🧍 “I can’t move!”

(1) Try repeating the operation one or two times to see if the freeze occurs at the same position.  
🟡 **(2)** Record a **complete video** from *startup slide → freeze point*,  
ensuring both the **emulator** and the **BAAS log interface** are visible on the same screen.

---

### ⚙️ “I set up the XXX configuration but it didn’t execute!”
or  
“I didn’t set up XXX but it executed anyway!”

(1) Carefully re-read the **configuration instructions** to confirm that the parameters were filled correctly.  
🟡 **(2)** Attach **configuration screenshots** and **program logs**.

---

✅ *Tip:* A complete report should allow another person to reproduce your issue **without guessing**.  
Providing logs, screenshots, and clear context saves everyone time and ensures faster fixes.
